# Project Planner

- A Project Planner developed using Vanilla JavaScript.
- This project planner uses drag & drop events too for the project. All the data inside it is static.
- Developed this project for learning OOP, Advanced Events, etc.
- I'm going to develop another Project Planner using a JS Framework.
- Adding more into this project later....
